Sure, I can analyze the provided EventController.js and suggest ways to automate the eventStatus field based on the Event.js and EventSignups.js mongoose models.

Here's how you can automate the eventStatus field in the controllers:

Identify the logic for updating eventStatus: There isn't a direct logic for updating eventStatus based on the provided controllers. The current logic seems to rely on manual intervention by the admin through updates (setting isApproved to false).

Possible Automation Strategies:

a. Time-based Automation:

You can implement a background job (like a cron job) that periodically checks for upcoming events.
The job can compare the startDate and endDate of the event with the current date and time.
If the current date and time is:
Before startDate: Set eventStatus to active.
Between startDate and endDate: Set eventStatus to full (assuming limited capacity).
After endDate: Set eventStatus to finished.
b. Capacity-based Automation:

You can leverage the EventSignups.js model's numberOfVisitors field.
In the createEvent controller, after saving the event, query for the total number of signups using EventSignups.find({ eventId: eventId }).
Compare the signup count with the event's capacity.
If the signup count reaches the capacity, update the event's eventStatus to full.
c. Combination Approach:

You can combine both time-based and capacity-based automation for a more robust solution.
Implementation in Controllers:

a. Time-based Automation:
This would require setting up a background job that runs periodically. The implementation details would depend on your chosen framework or server environment.

b. Capacity-based Automation:
In the createEvent controller, after saving the new event:

JavaScript
const event = await newEvent.save();
const totalSignups = await EventSignups.find({ eventId: event._id }).countDocuments();

if (totalSignups >= event.capacity) {
  await Event.findByIdAndUpdate(event._id, { eventStatus: 'full' });
}
Use code with caution.
You can similarly implement logic to update eventStatus to active before the event starts in other controllers like getAllEvents or a separate background job.

Additional Considerations:

Handle errors during background job execution and signup count retrieval.
Consider implementing a mechanism to notify the event organizer (if available) about status changes.
By implementing these suggestions, you can automate the eventStatus updates based on predefined criteria, reducing manual intervention from the admin.
